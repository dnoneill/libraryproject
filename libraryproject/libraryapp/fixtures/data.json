But when Anne begins her job as the new schoolteacher, the real test of her character begins. Along with teaching the three Rs, she is learning how complicated life can be when she meddles in someone else's romance, finds two new orphans at Green Gables, and wonders about the strange behaviour of the very handsome Gilbert Blythe. As Anne enters womanhood, her adventures touch the heart and the funny bone."}}, {"model": "libraryapp.book", "pk": 18, "fields": {"title": "The Count of Monte Cristo", "isbn": null, "author": 4785, "small_image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1309203605s/7126.jpg", "publisher": "Penguin Classics", "num_pages": 1276, "pubyear": 2003, "pubday": 27, "pubmonth": 5, "rating": null, "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7126.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo", "description": "'On what slender threads do life and fortune hang.'<br /><br />Thrown in prison for a crime he has not committed, Edmond Dant\u00e8s is confined to the grim fortress of If.
